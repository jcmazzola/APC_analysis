# A Statistical Analysis of UConn Field Hockey Attacking Penalty Corners

**University of Connecticutâ€“ Sports Statistical Learning Internship**

In the Fall 2024 semester, I had the opportunity to collaborate with UConn's Field Hockey team through the UConn Sports Statistical Learning Internship. This experience allowed me to investigate various factors influencing the success of attacking penalty corners. My aim was to provide actionable insights that could help enhance team strategies and improve performance outcomes.

This project is part of my broader effort to apply data science across a diverse range of fields, contributing valuable analysis to real-world challenges.
